# DWF WORLD PLOT

DWF World Plot is a script used to plot the locations
of the observatories around the world involved in the project
Deeper Wider Faster.

This requires:
`Basemap` which can be download here:
 <a href="https://github.com/matplotlib/basemap/releases"> Basemap </a>. 
Then follow the instructions in the README to install the GEOS library. 

You will also need to have: `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `pyproj`

__IMPORTANT NOTE:__ When specifying the coordinates of an observatory 
in the dictionary you specify them backwards. i.e (long, lat) NOT (lat, long).
